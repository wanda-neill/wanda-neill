I am an SMM manager at FollowZilla, a platform that delivers genuine, active connections on Instagram and other social networks.

- 👀 I’m interested in the role of machine learning and analytics in social media. With the right data and insights, there's so much potential for creating truly personalized and effective campaigns. I'm also fascinated by the ethical implications of data usage in our field—how do we balance effective targeting with respecting individual privacy?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about data science and how it can be applied to social media strategy. There's a lot of unstructured data in our field, and I'm keen to develop effective methods for harnessing this information. Understanding the nitty-gritty of algorithms can significantly enhance our campaign performance.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on the ethical application of machine learning in social media. Whether it's ensuring unbiased algorithms or developing new methods for user data privacy, I believe there's a lot of work to be done. If you're working on something along these lines, I'd love to contribute my social media analytics and strategy skills to the cause.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration or just a good tech-oriented chat. Let's innovate together!
